       'Bubble diagrams are useful in teasing out the relationships between different programs and spaces. Users are encouraged to consider things such as separations, adjacencies, thresholds, and hierarchy of spaces, etc. The bubble diagram can start to become an extremely abstract plan drawing. All of these might not necessarily translate into the built structure, but I think that they are nonetheless important to consider. 
Pen-and-paper: This is normally drawn on paper and colourized. 
App: can we integrate some sort of tool that allows users to place lines, dots, and other geometric shapes onto a virtual canvas with the ability to edit and resize them? This could be an easy way for users to resize and move about the program bubbles to experiment with different configurations.
AR: Maybe these bubble forms can be imposed onto the 3D terrain to have the programmatic layout more closely related to the context.
